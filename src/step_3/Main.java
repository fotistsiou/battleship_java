/**
 * Add shooting functionality
 * --------------------------
 * Description
 * The goal of this game is to sink all the ships of your opponent. Our fleet is not ready for a big battle yet, so
 * let's practice shooting on our field. Place all your units on the battlefield and take a shot!
 * In this step, you need to develop a system of shooting with accompanying messages about hits and misses.
 * --------------------------
 * Objectives
 * Take a shot at a prepared game field. You need to indicate the coordinates of the target, and the program should then
 * display a message about a hit or a miss. If the shell misses the target and falls in the water, this cell should be
 * marked with an M, and a successful strike is marked by an X. After this shot, the game should be stopped.
 * If the player managed to hit a ship, the game should display a message You hit a ship!; otherwise, the message is You
 * missed!
