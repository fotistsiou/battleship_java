/**
 * Add multiplayer option
 * ----------------------
 * Description
 * Here is a good way to show off your new skills: offer a friend to play a computer game that you wrote yourself! Of
 * course, it is much more fun to play Battleship with someone else: the possibility of winning or losing adds a thrill
 * to the game!
 * Both players add the ships to their fields one by one (no peeking!), and then start shelling each other until one of
 * them succeeds. To make the game fair and prevent the players from peeping at each other's fields, after each move add
 * the message "Press Enter and pass the move to another player", which will clear the screen.
 * ----------------------
 * Objectives
 * To complete this stage and the entire project, add a PvP component to your game. Now the player will see not only the
 * opponent's screen but their own as well. Place the opponent's screen at the top and your field at the bottom.
