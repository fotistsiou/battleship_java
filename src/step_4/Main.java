/**
 * Implement the "fog of war" feature
 * ----------------------------------
 * Description
 * It seems a little odd to shoot your own ships. Let's imagine they are not ours! You can ask a friend to place the
 * ships on the game field (or do it yourself, but it will be less exciting), and then the program will hide the ships
 * under the fog of war. You just have to take a blind shot.
 * ----------------------------------
 * Objectives
 * In this stage, you need to implement the "fog of war" feature in your game. First, place all the ships on the game
 * field, and then hide them with the symbol ~. Take a shot like in the previous stage, and after your attempt, the
 * program should print a message along with two versions of the field: one covered with the fog of war and the other
 * one uncovered.
