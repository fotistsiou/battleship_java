/**
 * Place all ships
 * ---------------
 * Description
 * Now that we've figured out the rules of the game let's continue with positioning the ships and drawing them on our
 * game field! The goal of this stage is to place all the ships on the game field according to the rules.
 * ---------------
 * Objectives
 * You have 5 ships:
 * - Aircraft Carrier is 5 cells
 * - Battleship is 4 cells
 * - Submarine is 3 cells
 * - Cruiser is also 3 cells
 * - Destroyer is 2 cells.
 * In this stage, you should arrange them all on the game field.
 * 1. Start placing your ships with the largest one.
 * 2. For each ship read two coordinates: the beginning and the end of the ship. Again, the order of the coordinates
 *    does not matter.
 * 3. Add new ships to a game field and output it the same way as in the previous stage.
 * 4. If the user has entered coordinates in such a way that the length of the created ship does not match the expected
 *    length, this should be considered an incorrect input. Also, the game rules state that ships cannot be adjacent to
 *    each other. For both of these cases report it with a message containing Error word.
