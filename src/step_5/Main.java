/**
 * Define rules to end the game
 * ----------------------------
 * Description
 * It looks like everything is ready for full-scale battlefield maneuvers! This time, don't cease fire until all the
 * ships are sunk. At the end of the game, your program should print a congratulatory message to the winner: You sank
 * the last ship. You won. Congratulations!
 * ----------------------------
 * Objectives
 * To complete this step, you should add a check that all the ships were successfully sunk. The game is supposed to go
 * on until all ships go down. The program should print an extra message You sank a ship! when all the cells of a
 * particular ship have been hit. Take a look at the examples below!
 * For the sake of simplicity; the project does not consider shots to coordinates that are already shot at to be any
 * different. Regardless of whether the coordinate was previously a hit or a miss, you should display You hit a ship!
 * and You missed! again respectively.
